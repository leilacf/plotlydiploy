### Overview
Improbable Beef, a bio-technology company is attempting to utilize bacteria that can play a primary role in synthetic beef replacement. In working with volunteer data, I was able to identify the top 10 bacterial species found in their navels. 

The volunteer data includes:
- ID numbers
- Navel washing frequency
- Ethnicity, gender, and age
- Location

For this analysis, I created an interactive dashboard which visualized the data, allowing for users to filter by their unique ID number, and see their results. Not only does this research and visualization benefit the individual volunteer, but largely contributes to the public scientific domain as we continue to explore belly button biodiversity and the bacterial effect.

The final results can be seen below:
